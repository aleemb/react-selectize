React wrapper for [Selectize ](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)
===============

##NO LONGER MAINTAINED

**The package was made as temporary solution and will be no longer maintained. 
Although you can still use it i would strongly recommend to switch for mature React UI library [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui) or alike.**

I have made simple React wrapper around selectize primarily for myself.
But if you find it helpful, fill free to use.

And of course fill free to add merge requests or register issues.
I will try to handle it as soon as i can.
