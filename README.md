React wrapper for [Selectize ](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)
===============

I have made simple React wrapper around selectize primarily for myself.
But if you find it helpful, fill free to use.

And of course fill free to add merge requests or register issues.
I will try to handle it as soon as i can.
